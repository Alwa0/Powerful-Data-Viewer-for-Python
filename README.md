# Powerful-Data-Viewer-for-Python

## Description

The application throw GUI takes the path to a csv file and python interpreter(optional).

Using python pandas library the app returns the interactive table based on the content of the csv file

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

Java: [install](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml)

Python interpreter: [install](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pandas.

```bash
pip install pandas
```
## Running the Tests

For running the tests you should add all files from the repository to one directory on your PC.

Using installed Java run the Main.java file that is on ~/src/sample 

To the opened app window you should write path to the csv file and to the python interpreter(optional). If you want to try my tests you should write ~/testing_data/d1.csv for the first test data or ~/testing_data/d2.csv for the second test data or you may use your own test data. After that you may add python interpreter path and click to the 'Show the table' button.

If the shown window is empty then you should close it and return back and check if the entered paths are correct and add the python path(if you did not do it yet)
